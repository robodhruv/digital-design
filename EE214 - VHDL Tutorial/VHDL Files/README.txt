Install ghdl from http://ghdl.free.fr
(ghdl is also available as a RPM package in ubuntu/fedora etc.)

You will also need to install gtkwave to view
waveforms.

Type 
. compile_ghdl.sh 

to compile the VHDL source code.  This produces
an executable name "testbench".  You can run the
executable by typing

./testbench

To run the simulation for 1000ns and to produce
a waveform in VCD format, type

./testbench --stop-time=1000ns --vcd=testbench.vcd


You can then view the waveforms generated by the
simulation using

gtkwave run.vcd
